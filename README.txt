Notes on how to run the Aaeon Up Board

-- Need more current than 2A power supply? Board crashed and will not boot with all USB ports filled with external devices (GPS, Arduino, Mouse, Keyboard)
-- Sudo Password is 'up'


Arduino
- Run as sudo from Desktop b/c up user is not root
- Use old bootloader for Ardruino Nano (ATmega328P - Old)
- Saved Stepper Motor control example in ~/Documents/AEHack-master/arduino
